    <em>Performance on a difficult matching pair compared to LightGlue.</em>
</p>

## Overview
LoMa is a fast and accurate family of local feature matchers. It works similar to [LightGlue](https://github.com/cvg/LightGlue) but significantly improves matching robustness and accuracy across benchmarks, even outperforming [RoMa](https://github.com/Parskatt/RoMa) and [RoMa v2](https://github.com/Parskatt/RoMaV2) on the difficult [WxBS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06603) benchmark. As LoMa leverages local keypoint descriptions, the models are perfect drop-in replacement in e.g. SfM and Visual Localization pipelines.

## Updates
- [April 6, 2026] LoMa inference code released. 

## How to Use
```python
import cv2
from loma import LoMa, LoMaB

# load pretrained model
model = LoMa(LoMaB())  # also available: LoMaB128, LoMaL, LoMaG
# Define image paths, e.g.
img_A_path, img_B_path = "assets/0015_A.jpg", "assets/0015_B.jpg"
# Extract matching keypoints in image coordinates
kptsA, kptsB = model.match(img_A_path, img_B_path)

# Find a fundamental matrix (or anything else of interest)
F, mask = cv2.findFundamentalMat(
    kptsA, kptsB, ransacReprojThreshold=0.2, method=cv2.USAC_MAGSAC, confidence=0.999999, maxIters=10000
)
```
We provide additional code examples in [demo.py](demo.py), which might help in understanding. To run the demo, use the following API:
```bash
uv run demo.py matcher:loma-b
```

## Setup/Install
In your python environment (tested on Linux python 3.12), run:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```
or 
```bash
uv sync
```

## Benchmarks
We initially provide code for evaluating on MegaDepth, ScanNet, WxBS and RUBIK. If you do not already have MegaDepth1500 and ScanNet1500, you may run the following to download them:
```bash
source scripts/eval_prep.sh
```
To run a benchmark you need to install the optional dependencies by e.g. `uv sync --extra eval`. Thereafter, you can use the following call signature:
```bash
uv run eval.py matcher:loma-b --benchmark wxbs
```
Use `uv run eval.py --help` to explore the different options. 

### Expected Results
The results are similar to those reported in the paper. For example, running the evaluation for LoMa-B on WxBS gives us `mAA_10px: 0.6876`.

## Sizes
We an array of models: LoMA-{B, B128, L, G}. For most usecases LoMa-B, which is the same size as LightGlue, works fine. LoMa-G is significantly heavier but gives the most accurate matches, even surpassing the RoMa-family on e.g. WxBS and IMC22.

## Checklist
- [x] Publish the inference code.
- [ ] Release a lightweight descriptor.
- [ ] Integrate with [HLoc](https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization?tab=readme-ov-file).
- [ ] Provide training code.
- [ ] Release HardMatch.

## Acknowledgement
Thanks to [Parskatt](https://github.com/Parskatt) for writing most of the code. Our codebase structure is mainly based on [RoMaV2](https://github.com/Parskatt/RoMaV2) and our architectures build on [LightGlue](https://github.com/cvg/lightglue), [DeDoDe](https://github.com/Parskatt/DeDoDe), and [DaD](https://github.com/Parskatt/dad).
